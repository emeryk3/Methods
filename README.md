## Methods

A method is a sequence of statements and are declared within a class. Methods are useful if you need to use the same code over and over again, remember the word DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).
 SYNTAX:
 <Returntype> name (parameterList)
 {
 Body Code
 }
 The method name should be something meaningful, and the same variable naming rules apply, so something like customer$name is not valid.
 turnType – The returnType is the data type: int, string etc. Methods also return a value; if your method does not return a value then you must use the keyword void instead of returnType.
 name – The name, as discussed earlier, is the method name.
 ParameterList – This describes the type of information you want to pass on to the method. This is set in the brackets (or parentheses); if you set more than two parameters you separate them witha comma.  The ParameterList is optional.*/

 ## Variables in Method:
You can create variables in methods; however before using a method you must declare it, and that variable can only be used within that method. This is called scope and the variables are called local variables.
